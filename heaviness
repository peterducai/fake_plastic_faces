dissolve it, tear it down
this heavy hate
dragging you to the ground
there's nothing else
just memories
from battlefield
but noone's left
to talk about
you won't last long
despite armor and the shield


heaviness
of words you keep inside
heaviness
of the thoughts you keep alive

your bitten tongue
spit it out
heaviness of your own blood
drags you down
spit it loud
